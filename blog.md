Outliners: 

- From blogto to hmu
- Three in one Lemon Squeezy + hashnode + LinkTree(or Bento)
- Class Variance vs Data attributes, use shadcn and sonner example
- One more thing - AI
- More to Come - more component
- Why hmu ? => nextjs app router based, Link Preview API
- More to come - Analytics 
-

I remember building blogto, it was my fist vscode extension by which you can upload, your markdown blog to hashnode, medium and dev\.to 

here is the link of the extension : https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=coolhead.blogto

The aim for blogto was that i wanted to learn how to build an vscode extension. 

Currently, Blogto works only for medium, hashnode deprecated the api.
